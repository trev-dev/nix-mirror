# Dotfiles, System and Environment

Having spent a lot of time in various Linux distributions, I have settled on a home in NixOS.  The package availability is good, the configuration language is ok and my home environment is pretty portable.  I was even able to adapt it for WL2 for work purposes.

## What's inside

If you're viewing this on [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~trevdev/configs/), then you should be able to see most/all the repos included in my dotfiles.  I keep things like Emacs/Neovim separate from nix.  They're too fiddly and have their own package managers.

Otherwise my nix config covers my base system and home environment, as well as numerous dotfiles for stuff like my display manager, terminal emulator config, note taking app (zk), etc.

Enjoy yer browsing.
